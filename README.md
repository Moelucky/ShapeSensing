# Uphole Drilling: Trajectory Deviation Prediction and Sensing
Uphole drillign deviation in underground hardrock mining leads to massive loss in mining value chain- mine to mill.
This project develops a ML solution to predict deviation from geological information to optimise explosives use and increase effiency.

This project includes the following steps:
 1- Data collection 
 2- Estimation of deviation
 3- Correction of drilling patterns
