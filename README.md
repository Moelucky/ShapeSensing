# Uphole Drilling: Trajectory Deviation Prediction and Sensing
Uphole drillign deviation in underground hardrock mining leads to massive loss in mining value chain- mine to mill.
This project develops a ML solution to predict deviation from geological information to optimise explosives use and increase effiency.

This project includes the following steps:<br /> 
 1- Data collection <br /> 
 2- Estimation of deviation<br /> 
 3- Train model and predict<br /> 
 3- Correction of drilling patterns
